# Georges-Portfolio
 A little project for a 3D-webpage-style portfolio to help me learn about 3D animations while showing off some of my skills and previous projects.


# Plan
Base site is in place, with planets, lights, 3D text and animations that go with these, such as the text always facing the screen and the planets rotating.

Tasks: 

- Add some kind of instructions explaining how to navigate the page (maybe on the sun?)

- Create different pages for each apsect of the portfolio (React routes could be useful here)
    - Make planets clickable to be able to take you to their respective pages
    - Experience Timeline
        - Implement carousel function into the saturn ring when clicked to use as the experience timeline
            - Make spinning the carousel smooth with momentum scrolling and make it snap into place on the nearest element of the carousel
    - Personal Statement
        - Create space invaders style feature with space ship at the bottom of the page and asteroids floating over random parts of the text which can be cleared by shooting with the spaceship
    - Skills
        -Includes software I can use, languages I can code in, links to past projects, professional skills, agile working, etc
    - Other
        - Includes things like contact details, social media, possible interests etc
    

- Create spaceship that hovers at the bottom centre of the screen
    - Make animation where spaceship flies to a planet when clicked
    - Make animation where spaceship is leaving planet when going back to solar system


- Create background shooting star/ comet with a trail that says 'George Spicer's Portfolio'
    - Could contain a link to 10 second intro video
